# MedFr_sample
This repository contains the sample code from my project at Vanderbilt's Data Science Institute.

# Goal
In this sample code, I aim to explore the capabilities of Google's Gemini models to effectively translate Medieval French to English and vice-versa, including several dialects of Medieval French. Our final deliverable is an application that integrates the Gemini API into a UI for translation purposes.

# Background
This project leverages a large language model (LLM) capable of understanding and generating text in various Medieval French dialects. Initially, state-of-the-art models like ChatGPT and Llama were insufficient for producing high-quality text in these dialects. However, with the release of Google's Gemini, we pivoted to using this model for its promising translation capabilities. The application we develop will translate between English and Medieval French, and generate new Medieval French text based on user instructions.

# Data
We are utilizing text documents containing Medieval French and their English translations for training. These documents include both paragraph-level translations and, ideally, line-by-line translations.

# Models
We are using Googleâ€™s Gemini 1 & 1.5 models for this project. The application will rely on Gemini's API for the core functionality of translating and generating Medieval French text.
